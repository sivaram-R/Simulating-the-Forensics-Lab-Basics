## Aim :

To install VirtualBox and set up a virtual machine(Kali Linux), install Autopsy and Sleuth Kit, and use them for forensic investigation by analyzing disk storage and file system.

## Implementation Steps :

### Step 1: Install VirtualBox

🔗 Download VirtualBox: click here

### Installation Steps:

1. Download the Windows hosts .exe file from the official VirtualBox website.
   
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
  
3. Once installed, launch VirtualBox to verify the installation.
   
### Step 2: Install Kali Linux on VirtualBox

🔗 Download Kali Linux VM: Click Here

### Installation Steps:
1. Download the Kali Linux ISO file.Open VirtualBox, click New, enter "Kali Linux", select Type: Linux and Version: Debian (64-bit).
   
2.Set RAM to at least 4GB ,Set disk storage to at least 30GB, choose Dynamically Allocated or Fixed Size, and create the VM.

3. Go to Settings > Storage, click Empty under Controller: IDE.4
   
4. Select Graphical Install, follow the prompts to set language, location, username, and password.
   
5. Choose Partitioning Method (Guided - Use Entire Disk) and wait for installation to complete.
   
### Step 3: Install Autopsy (GUI-based Forensic Tool)

🔗 Download Autopsy: Click Here

### Installation Steps:

1. Download the Autopsy Windows Installer from the official website.

2. Extract the ZIP file and open the bin folder.
   
3. Run autopsy.exe and set up a new forensic case for analysis.
   
### Step 4: Install Sleuth Kit (CLI-based Forensic Tools)

🔗 Download Sleuth Kit: Click Here

## Installation Steps:

1. Download the Windows ZIP package from the official website.
   
2. Extract the ZIP folder and move it to a suitable directory (e.g., C:\sleuthkit).

3. Add the bin folder to Windows PATH:
     Open Control Panel → System → Advanced System Settings.
     Click Environment Variables → Edit Path.
     Add the Sleuth Kit bin folder path and save changes.
   
4. Verify installation by running:

```
fls -version
```

### Step 5: Create & Configure a Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) in Windows

1. Press Win + X, Select Disk Management.
 
2. Click Action > Create VHD.
   
3. Choose a location and set a disk size (e.g., 10GB+).
   
4. Select Fixed Size or Dynamically Expanding and click OK.
   
5. In Disk Management, find your new disk (marked as "Not Initialized") -> Right-click the new disk → Initialize Disk → Select MBR.
   
6. Right-click Unallocated Space → New Simple Volume → Format the disk -> Click next → Finish.
